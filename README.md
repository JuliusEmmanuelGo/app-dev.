## OVERVIEW
** The Longest Yard is a 2005 American sports comedy film directed by Peter Segal and written by Sheldon Turner. A remake of 1974's The Longest Yard, it stars Adam Sandler as a washed-up former professional American football quarterback who, in exchange for a reduced prison sentence, is forced to assemble a team to play against the guards.**
### FEATURES
- Disgraced pro football quarterback Paul Crewe (Adam Sandler) lands in jail, where manipulative Warden Hazen (James Cromwell) recruits him to advise the institution's team. This turns into a lead role quarterbacking a crew of inmates in a game against a team of prison guards. Aided by incarcerated ex-NFL coach Nate Scarborough (Burt Reynolds), Crewe and his team must overcome not only the bloodthirstiness of the opposition, but also the corrupt officials trying to fix the game against them.
- Paul Crewe is a former National Football League quarterback who was accused of shaving points. Though it was never confirmed, he was placed on federal probation for five years
- Caretaker unknowingly enters the cell to give a photo gift to Crewe, but is killed when he tries to turn the dial on the radio.
- The Mean Machines rally behind Crewe and with a decisive two-point conversion, they win the game by a one-point margin.
